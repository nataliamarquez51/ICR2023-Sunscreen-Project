	abstract = {Background: Microfine zinc oxide (Z-Cote) is used as a transparent broad-spectrum sunblock to attenuate UV radiation (UVR), including UVA I (340-400 nm).
Objective: Our purpose was to assess the suitability of microfine zinc oxide as a broadspectrum photoprotective agent by examining those properties generally considered important in sunscreens: attenuation spectrum, sun protection factor (SPF) contribution, photostability, and photoreactivity.
Methods: Attenuation spectrum was assessed by means of standard spectrophotometric methods. SPF contribution was evaluated according to Food and Drug Administration standards. Photostability was measured in vitro by assessing SPF before and after various doses of UVR. Photoreactivity was evaluated by subjecting a microfine zinc oxide/organic sunscreen formulation to escalating doses of UVR and determining the percentage of organic sunscreen remaining.
Results: Microfine zinc oxide attenuates throughout the UVR spectrum, including UVA I. It is photostable and does not react with organic sunscreens under irradiation.
Conclusion: Microfine zinc oxide is an effective and safe sunblock that provides broadspectrum UV protection, including protection from long-wavelength UVA. (J Am Acad Dermatol 1999;40:85-90.)},

UV filters have demonstrated endocrine disrupting potential in vertebrate models, but few studies have addressed their effects on resident aquatic invertebrates. The acute and chronic effects of the UV filters avobenzone, dioxybenzone, homosalate, OMCN octisalate, and oxybenzone on D. magna were assessed. Only avobenzone was acutely toxicity at LC50 0.74 mg/L. A potential hormetic effect on reproduction was noted in dioxybenzone, homosalate, octisalate, and oxybenzone (LOEC 0.75, 0.075, 0.0019, 0.7 mg/L). Male neonates, a potential indication of endocrine disruption, were identified in avobenzone, homosalate, and oxybenzone tests (LOEC 0.004, 0.6, and 5 mg/L). Environmental monitoring of UV filters is limited, especially in recreational lake areas. The current work identified the presence octisalate, homosalate, oxybenzone, and OMCN in selected US lakes using GC/MS. A seasonal and spatial effect on UV filter concentration was noted for the detected UV filters, but only octisalate, homosalate, and oxybenzone were found to be significant. Hazard quotients (HQ) were calculated using the maximum environmental concentration from this study and LOEC from our toxicological study and previous studies. HQ’s for detected UV filter were well below 1, indicating the tested UV filters are not likely occurring in environmentally relevant concentrations. Many anthropogenic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and insecticides have demonstrated potential for endocrine disruption. Despite this knowledge, teaching this concept in undergraduate labs is not common. A research system using the invertebrate D. magna and the pesticide fenoxycarb is presented that demonstrates endocrine disruption, alleviates the complications of vertebrate models, and engages students in an authentic research experience. The system has been implemented in a small class containing a variety of declared major with 90\% of the students showing proficiency in procedures and conceptual knowledge.},

	abstract = {The increasing use of nanomaterials in healthcare and industrial products heightens the possibility of their ingestion by humans, other mammals, and fish. While toxicity of many nanomaterials has recently been studied, reports of non-lethal effects of nanomaterials remain ill-defined. This study investigates possible pathways by which nanoparticles, titanium dioxide (TiO2), could cross the epithelium layer by employing both toxicity and mechanistic studies. This study provides evidence that at 10 μg/mL and above, TiO2 nanoparticles cross the epithelial lining of the intestinal model by transcytosis, albeit at low levels. TiO2 was able to penetrate into and through the cells without disrupting junctional complexes, as measured by γ-catenin. To monitor the epithelial integrity, transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was employed and determined low concentrations (10 or 100 μg/mL) of TiO2 do not disrupt epithelial integrity. Live/dead analysis results did not show cell death after exposure to TiO2. In addition, at 10 μg/mL (and above) TiO2 nanoparticles begin alteration of both microvillar organization on the apical surface of the epithelium as well as induce a rise in intracellular-free calcium. The latter is a mechanism cells use to respond to extracellular stimuli and may be linked to the alteration of the apical microvilli. Although TiO2 does not show cell death, the implication of other, non-lethal, effects could lead to undesired outcomes (i.e., disease, malnutrition, shortened life span, etc.).},

The white mineral has a wide range of applications in photocatalysis, in the pharmaceutical industry, and in food processing sectors. Its practical uses stem from its dual feature to act as both a semiconductor and light scatterer. Optical performance is therefore of relevance in understanding how titanium dioxide impacts these industries. Recent breakthroughs are summarised herein, focusing on whether restructuring the surface properties of titanium dioxide either enhances or inhibits its reactivity, depending on the required application. Its recent exposure as a potential carcinogen to humans has been linked to controversies around titanium dioxide’s toxicity; this is discussed by illustrating discrepancies between experimental protocols of toxicity assays and their results. In all, it is important to review the latest achievements in fast-growing industries where titanium dioxide prevails, while keeping in mind insights into its disputed toxicity.},

Ultraviolet A (UVA)-induced tanning seems to result from the photooxidation of pre-existing melanin and contributes no photoprotection. However, data available for melanin biodegradation remain limited. In this study, we first examined photodegradation of eumelanin and pheomelanin in human black hairs and found that the ratio of Free (formed by peroxidation in situ) to Total (after hydrogen peroxide oxidation) pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA) increases with hair aging, indicating fission of the dihydroxyindole moiety. In red hair, the ratio of thiazole-2,4,5-tricarboxylic acid (TTCA) to 4-amino-3-hydroxyphenylalanine (4-AHP) increases with aging, indicating the conversion from benzothiazine to benzothiazole moiety. These photodegradation of melanins were confirmed by UVA (not UVB) irradiation of melanins from mice and human hairs and synthetic eumelanin and pheomelanin. These results show that both eumelanin and pheomelanin degrade by UVA and that Free/Total PTCA and TTCA/4-AHP ratios serve as sensitive indicators of photodegradation.},

In environmental abundance, UV is the most important modifiable risk factor for skin cancer and many other environmentally-influenced skin disorders. However, UV also benefits human health by mediating natural synthesis of vitamin D and endorphins in the skin, therefore UV has complex and mixed effects on human health. Nonetheless, excessive exposure to UV carries profound health risks, including atrophy, pigmentary changes, wrinkling and malignancy. UV is epidemiologically and molecularly linked to the three most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, which together affect more than a million Americans annually. Genetic factors also influence risk of UV-mediated skin disease. Polymorphisms of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene, in particular, correlate with fairness of skin, UV sensitivity, and enhanced cancer risk. We are interested in developing UV-protective approaches based on a detailed understanding of molecular events that occur after UV exposure, focusing particularly on epidermal melanization and the role of the MC1R in genome maintenance.},

Drug delivery as well as risk assessment depends crucially on the ability of such carriers to overcome the skin barrier and reach deeper tissue layers. Therefore, the interaction of nanoparticles with skin and especially skin models is an intriguing field. However, the data obtained do not show a clear image on the effect of nano-carriers. Especially the penetration of such particles is an open and controversially discussed topic. The literature reports different results mainly on pig or murine skin showing strong penetration (pig and mouse) or the opposite. Looking only at the sizes of the particles also no conclusive picture can be obtained. Nevertheless, size is regarded to play an important role for skin penetration. Furthermore, the state of the skin influences penetration (hydration) and the mechanical stress is of outmost importance.},

Earlier publications suggested, however, that the primary action of UV protection by these sunscreen agents is through absorption and not by reflection. The purpose of this work was to quantitate the contributions of each of these modes of action to the protection provided by inorganic UV sunscreen filters. Methods An optical integrating sphere was used to measure the transmission and the reflectance of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Results The average range of reflection for zinc oxide and titanium dioxide throughout the UV range was only 4–5\% (less than SPF 2), providing minimal UV protection via this mechanism. The remainder of the UV protection is provided by semiconductor band gap mediated absorbance of the UV photons. At wavelengths above the semiconductor band gap absorption energy levels (in the long UVA and visible wavelengths), they are predominantly reflectors of light (up to 60\% reflection) and non-absorbing. Conclusion Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide provide UV protection primarily via absorption of UV radiation and not through significant reflection or scattering.},

	abstract = {The reflection of light on a surface is a common phenomenon, so common that even physicist forget about the amazing physics involved. Under a classical physics perspective, light is an electromagnetic wave, in other words, light is an oscillating electric field. 

When the light encounters the surface of a material, the electrons of that material naturally oscillate because subjected to the oscillating electric field of the incident light.

But… these electrons themselves carry a charge, thus produce their own electric field, that in turn oscillates too: that means that the electrons produce light also! We perceive that light as reflection (and refraction). 

The light emitted by the electrons is produced in all directions. Many of these rays are cancelled out by destructive interference. The rays of light that survive (resulting from constructive interference give rise to the reflection (and refraction) rules.

	abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelength shorter than that of visible light, but longer than X-rays. UV radiation is present in sunlight, and constitutes about 10\% of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun. It is also produced by electric arcs, Cherenkov radiation, and specialized lights, such as mercury-vapor lamps, tanning lamps, and black lights. Although long-wavelength ultraviolet is not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack the energy to ionize atoms, it can cause chemical reactions and causes many substances to glow or fluoresce. Many practical applications, including chemical and biological effects, derive from the way that UV radiation can interact with organic molecules. These interactions can involve absorption or adjusting energy states in molecules, but do not necessarily involve heating.Short-wave ultraviolet light damages DNA and sterilizes surfaces with which it comes into contact. For humans, suntan and sunburn are familiar effects of exposure of the skin to UV light, along with an increased risk of skin cancer. The amount of UV light produced by the Sun means that the Earth would not be able to sustain life on dry land if most of that light were not filtered out by the atmosphere. More energetic, shorter-wavelength "extreme" UV below 121 nm ionizes air so strongly that it is absorbed before it reaches the ground. However, ultraviolet light (specifically, UVB) is also responsible for the formation of vitamin D in most land vertebrates, including humans. The UV spectrum, thus, has effects both beneficial and harmful to life.
The lower wavelength limit of human vision is conventionally taken as 400 nm, so ultraviolet rays are invisible to humans, although people can sometimes perceive light at shorter wavelengths than this. Insects, birds, and some mammals can see near-UV (NUV) (i.e., slightly shorter wavelengths than what humans can see).},

	abstract = {Pyrimidine dimers are molecular lesions formed from thymine or cytosine bases in DNA via photochemical reactions, commonly associated with direct DNA damage. Ultraviolet light (UV; particularly UVC) induces the formation of covalent linkages between consecutive bases along the nucleotide chain in the vicinity of their carbon–carbon double bonds. The photo-coupled dimers are fluorescent.  The dimerization reaction can also occur among pyrimidine bases in dsRNA (double-stranded RNA)—uracil or cytosine. Two common UV products are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6–4 photoproducts. These premutagenic lesions alter the structure of the DNA helix and cause non-canonical base pairing. Specifically, adjacent thymines or cytosines in DNA will form a cyclobutane ring when joined together and cause a distortion in the DNA. This distortion prevents replication or transcription machinery beyond the site of the dimerization. Up to 50–100 such reactions per second might occur in a skin cell during exposure to sunlight, but are usually corrected within seconds by photolyase reactivation or nucleotide excision repair. In humans, the most common form of DNA repair is nucleotide excision repair (NER). In contrast, organisms such as bacteria can counterintuitively harvest energy from the sun to fix DNA damage from pyrimidine dimers via photolyase activity. If these lesions are not fixed, polymerase machinery may misread or add in the incorrect nucleotide to the strand. If the damage to the DNA is overwhelming, mutations can arise within the genome of an organism and may lead to the production of cancer cells. Uncorrected lesions can inhibit polymerases, cause misreading during transcription or replication, or lead to arrest of replication. It causes sunburn and it triggers the production of melanin. Pyrimidine dimers are the primary cause of melanomas in humans.},

	abstract = {The carcinogenic action of UVA radiation is commonly attributed to DNA oxidation mediated by endogenous photosensitisers. Yet, it was recently shown that cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), well known for their involvement in UVB genotoxicity, are produced in larger yield than oxidative lesions in UVA-irradiated cells and skin. In the present work, we gathered mechanistic information on this photoreaction by comparing formation of all possible bipyrimidine photoproducts upon UVA irradiation of cells, purified genomic DNA and dA20:dT20 oligonucleotide duplex. We observed that the distribution of photoproducts, characterized by the sole formation of CPD and the absence of (6-4) photoproducts was similar in the three types of samples. The CPD involving two thymines represented 90\% of the amount of photoproducts. Moreover, the yields of formation of the DNA lesions were similar in cells and isolated DNA. In addition, the effect of the wavelength of the incident photons was found to be the same in isolated DNA and cells. This set of data shows that UVA-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are formed via a direct photochemical mechanism, without mediation of a cellular photosensitiser. This is possible because the double-stranded structure increases the capacity of DNA bases to absorb UVA photons, as evidenced in the case of the oligomer dA20:dT20. These results emphasize the need to consider UVA in the carcinogenic effects of sunlight. An efficient photoprotection is needed that can only be complete by completely blocking incident photons, rather than by systemic approaches such as antioxidant supplementation.},

	abstract = {Our customers often ask us how much zinc oxide should a sunscreen have? The answer is fairly complex, but it breaks down into 4 basic parts:

Why use zinc oxide sunscreens?
The importance of non-nano zinc oxide
FDA's limit on zinc oxide
What percentage should you look for?

 
Why use zinc oxide sunscreens?
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a compound of zinc and oxygen and, unlike common sunscreen ingredients, is biochemically matched to human systems. It is the only sunscreen active ingredient FDA-approved for use on children less than 6 months old. Zinc is a critical mineral element used to keep humans healthy and found in many multivitamins.
Zinc oxide works by forming a barrier that protects skin from UV rays as well as moisture and irritants. Zinc oxide holds tight to its electrons when it absorbs UV energy, limiting creation of free radicals that cause oxidative damage or increase the risk of skin cancer. Most importantly for UV defense, and unlike ANY other active sunscreen ingredient (including titanium dioxide), it covers the ENTIRE UVA-UVB-UVC spectrum, and vitally at the same effectiveness. In other words, it protects deep tissues just as well as surface tissues.
This isn't true of any other ingredient, or collection of ingredients.
 
The importance of non-nano zinc oxide
Non-Nano Zinc Oxide is the best sunscreen active ingredient, for both human and marine biosystems. If a product uses non-nano, it will state this clearly within the ingredients; otherwise, it is almost assuredly NANO (meaning particle sizes less than a nanometer) and should not be used, because zinc oxide is toxic to most marine biosystems, including coral reefs. (Such products are usually marketed as “sheer” and “clear.”)
Remember, the term "reef safe" is not regulated, and any product can claim it, regardless of its ingredients.
Non-nano zinc oxide is highly stable under most conditions, including when hit with UV rays. It absorbs UV energy via band gap absorption (it reflects and scatters visible light, that’s why it looks white), preventing skin penetration and cell damage.
 
FDA's limit on zinc oxide
Topical zinc oxide products have been available in the US before 1938. As an active ingredient in over-the-counter sunscreen and skin protectant products, the FDA allows for a concentration of zinc oxide up to 25\%. In 2019, the FDA proposed that zinc oxide be classified as safe and effective, in contrast to petrochemicals, none of which the FDA recognizes as safe.
In addition to sunscreen, zinc oxide is used in food fortification. Zinc oxide is often added to cereals and nutrition bars to increase the nutritional value. Inorganic compounds such as zinc oxide can be safely used under FDA regulations.
Waxhead sunscreens use ONLY top-quality food-grade non-nano zinc oxide.
 
What percentage zinc to look for?
We recommend looking on the sunscreen label for a zinc oxide concentration of 20-25\% for best protection from UVA and UVB rays. In general, the more zinc oxide, the higher the UV protection, regardless of various products' stated SPF values (many of which are achieved by gaming the SPF tests by using anti-inflammatory ingredients to suppress the skin's natural red reaction).
It is so important to read sunscreen labels and understand the ingredients used in your skincare products. And remember, many companies label their products as “reef-safe” simply because they don’t contain a few of the currently banned petrochemical ingredients, but they contain several other petrochemical ingredients that make them completely UNSAFE for reefs and other marine life, not to mention their long term toxicity to humans.
Always read the ingredients, know what those ingredients do, and decide for yourself.

	url = {https://gowaxhead.com/blogs/the-thrive-lab/non-nano-zinc-oxide},
	abstract = {What's the difference between non-nano zinc oxide and nano-sized zinc oxide in sunscreen?
The answer can be complex.
 
Non-Nano Zinc Oxide (not small)
Non-nano particles are much larger and more consistent in size than nano-sized particles. These large particles do not seep through skin pores and so do not enter the bloodstream. Non-nano sunscreens are generally “more white” in appearance on the skin.
 
Nano Zinc Oxide (small)
Nano particles have a diameter smaller than 100 nanometers or 0.1 micron. (A micron is one millionth of a meter.)
Nano particles may be hazardous for humans, since they’re tiny enough to enter the bloodstream through the skin. Most nano-particle sunscreens contain particles of only 15 nanometers, or about 85\% SMALLER than the limit.
 

Mineral Sunscreens
All mineral sunscreens on the market are either micron-sized (non-nano), micronized or nano. (Some companies use micronized particles but may still be using nano particles because nano particles are technically a finer version of the micronized form.)
Many mineral sunscreens use nano zinc oxide because it is less whitening, which some consider more aesthetically appealing than the classic whiteness from non-nano (larger) mineral compounds. Products marketed as “clear” or "shear" mineral sunscreens use nano-sized varieties of zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.
The only way to ensure non-nano is if the company explicitly states particle size average and standard deviation, as we do below.
 
The Risks and Dangers of Nano Zinc Oxide
Most importantly, nano particle sunscreens harm reefs and marine life, since the small particles readily enter and negatively affect marine biosystems. Any sunscreen that uses nano-sized zinc oxide or titanium dioxide is NOT reef safe.
Nano particles can also absorb through human skin and into the bloodstream, where they can affect human biosystems. There is yet no evidence to show this is harmful, but there hasn’t been a large amount of research, and so the issue remains undetermined. Our approach is to use caution until definitive scientific evidence is available, and since the use of nano particles does not increase sunscreen effectiveness, we avoid nano particles in our products because there’s little reason to accept possible increased risks without corresponding benefits.
 
“Reef safe” can be Misleading
Remember, the term "reef safe" is unregulated, and many sunscreen brands market their products as “reef-safe” simply because they don’t contain 2 specific petrochemical ingredients banned by a growing list of government jurisdictions. However, they contain several other petrochemical ingredients (or nano sized mineral compounds) that make them completely UNSAFE for reefs and other marine life, not to mention the humans using them.
 
Waxhead Sunscreen
Waxhead does not use nano particle zinc oxide — we use ONLY top quality non-nano zinc oxide. This particle size range has been used for decades and is considered completely safe.
The average individual particle size of the Zinc Oxide USP we use is 0.260 microns (260nm) with a standard deviation of 0.012 micron (12nm). Hence, there are statistically zero particles smaller than 100nm, the cutoff for the nano classification. Most nano sunscreens on the market have particle sizes in the range of 10-20nm.
